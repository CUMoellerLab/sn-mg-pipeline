def _validate_parameters(dm, num_prototypes, seedset=None):
    '''Validate the paramters for each algorithm.
    Parameters
    ----------
    dm: skbio.stats.distance.DistanceMatrix
        Pairwise distances for all elements in the full set S.
    num_prototypes: int
        Number of prototypes to select for distance matrix.
        Must be >= 2, since a single prototype is useless.
        Must be smaller than the number of elements in the distance matrix,
        otherwise no reduction is necessary.
    seedset: iterable of str
        A set of element IDs that are pre-selected as prototypes. Remaining
        prototypes are then recruited with the prototype selection algorithm.
        Warning: It will most likely violate the global objective function.
    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        The number of prototypes to be found should be at least 2 and at most
        one element smaller than elements in the distance matrix. Otherwise, a
        ValueError is raised.
        The IDs in the seed set must be unique, and must be present in the
        distance matrix. Otherwise, a ValueError is raised.
        The size of the seed set must be smaller than the number of prototypes
        to be found. Otherwise, a ValueError is raised.

    '''Heuristically select k prototypes for given distance matrix.

       Prototype selection is NP-hard. This is an implementation of a greedy
       correctness heuristic: Start with the complete set and iteratively
       remove elements until the number of required prototypes is left.
       The decision which element shall be removed is based on the minimal
       distance sum this element has to all other.

    Parameters
    ----------
    dm: skbio.stats.distance.DistanceMatrix
        Pairwise distances for all elements in the full set S.
    num_prototypes: int
        Number of prototypes to select for distance matrix.
        Must be >= 2, since a single prototype is useless.
        Must be smaller than the number of elements in the distance matrix,
        otherwise no reduction is necessary.
    seedset: iterable of str
        A set of element IDs that are pre-selected as prototypes. Remaining
        prototypes are then recruited with the prototype selection algorithm.
        Warning: It will most likely violate the global objective function.

    Returns
    -------
    list of str
        A sequence holding selected prototypes, i.e. a sub-set of the
        IDs of the elements in the distance matrix.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        The number of prototypes to be found should be at least 2 and at most
        one element smaller than elements in the distance matrix. Otherwise, a
        ValueError is raised.
